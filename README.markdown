# Emporio

Emporio is an open source digital commerce platform written in Java. It was
built from the ground up to work with Liferay Portal so that Liferay developers
can leverage fully integrated web content management systems and best-in-breed
portal capabilities in their commerce projects.

Liferay designed Emporio for commerce projects that are very large or complex;
it can support millions of products in challenging B2B industries.

## Quick Start

Requirements: [Liferay Portal 7.1 GA1](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal)

1. Clone the Emporio repository (this [repository](https://github.com/liferay/com-liferay-commerce))
to the same level of your directory tree as your Liferay Home folder (Liferay
Home is the folder that contains the Tomcat folder for Liferay 7.1).

2. Start Liferay Portal 7.1.

In the terminal, navigate to the source code folder
(`com-liferay-commerce`).

Windows Users: enter `gradlew.bat deploy -Dbuild.profile=portal`

MacOS/Linux: enter `./gradlew deploy -Dbuild.profile=portal`

This takes a few minutes. When the build is complete, go to--or refresh--
http://localhost:8080 in your browser. Emporio's features are now available in
your Portal instance.
