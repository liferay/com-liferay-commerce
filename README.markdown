# Liferay Commerce

Liferay Commerce is an open source digital commerce platform written in Java. It was
built from the ground up to work with Liferay Portal so that Liferay developers
can leverage fully integrated web content management systems and best-in-breed
portal capabilities in their commerce projects.

Liferay designed it for commerce projects that are very large or complex;
it can support millions of products in challenging B2B industries.

## Quick Start

Requirements: [Liferay Portal 7.1 GA1](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal)

1.  Clone the Liferay Commerce repository (this
    [repository](https://github.com/liferay/com-liferay-commerce)) to the same
    level of your directory tree as your Liferay Home folder (Liferay Home is
    the folder that contains the Tomcat folder for Liferay 7.1).

    Alternatively, you can determine where Commerce will deploy by passing in
    a path to Liferay Home in your `gradle.properties` file. For example:
    `app.server.parent.dir=/home/computer/Documents/liferay-ce-7.1.0-ga1/`

2.  Start Liferay Portal 7.1.

    In the terminal, navigate to the source code folder
    (`com-liferay-commerce`).

    Windows Users: enter `gradlew.bat deploy -Dbuild.profile=portal`

    MacOS/Linux: enter `./gradlew deploy -Dbuild.profile=portal`

   This takes a few minutes.

3.  When the build is complete, run a full reindex of all search indexes. Go
    to--or refresh-- http://localhost:8080 in your browser. In the left-hand
    menu, go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *Search* and
    click *Execute* next to *Reindex all search indexes*.

Liferay Commerce's features are now available in your Portal instance.
