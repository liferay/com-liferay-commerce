/**
 * Provides the HTTP utility for the
 * {@link com.liferay.commerce.batch.service.CommerceBatchJobExecutionServiceUtil} service utility. The
 * static methods of this class calls the same methods of the service utility.
 * However, the signatures are different because it requires an additional
 * {@link com.liferay.portal.kernel.security.auth.HttpPrincipal} parameter.
 *
 * <p>
 * The benefits of using the HTTP utility is that it is fast and allows for
 * tunneling without the cost of serializing to text. The drawback is that it
 * only works with Java.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Set the property <b>tunnel.servlet.hosts.allowed</b> in portal.properties to
 * configure security.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The HTTP utility is only generated for remote services.
